### Working with Remotes
#### To be able to collaborate on any Git project, you need to know how to manage your remote repositories. Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. You can have several of them, each of which generally is either read-only or read/write for you.

#### In order to collaborate on Git projects, you must interact with remote repositories, versions of a project residing online or on a network. You can work with multiple repositories, for which you can have read/write or read-only privileges. Teams can use remote repositories to push information to and pull data from.

#### Seeing Your Remotes

#####  Collaborating with others involves managing these remote repositories and pushing and pulling data to and from them when you need to share work. Managing remote repositories includes:
- knowing how to add remote repositories
- remove remotes that are no longer valid
- manage various remote branches
- define them as being tracked or not, and more.


#### To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the git remote command. It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you’ve specified

#### You can also specify -v, which shows you the URLs that Git has stored for the shortname to be used when reading and writing to that remote.
- If you have more than one remote, the command lists them all.
