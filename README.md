## The growth mindset
### The growth mindset can open pathways to more creativity and possibility, and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement.
#### In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.

#### 3 reminders to myself of how to keep myself in a growth mindset:
1. View challenges as opportunities.
2. Replace the word failing with the word learning.
3. Use the word yet.
   - Dweck says “not yet” has become one of her favourite phrases. Whenever you see students struggling with a task, just tell them they haven’t mastered it yet.
