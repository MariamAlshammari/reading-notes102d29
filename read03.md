#HTML

#### People access websites using software called a web browser All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.
- Most web pages also include extra content such as images, audio, video, or animations
- When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.


**The use of headings and subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of information.**

**Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags. Some example:**
1. Body
2. Head
3. Title
 **Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML.**
1. HTML 4 Released 1997 
2. XHTML 1.0 Released 2000
3. HTML5 Released 2000

**DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using. X You can add comments to your code between the markers. X The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.**


 *The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure. X The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple 
elements). X Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements. X To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.*
